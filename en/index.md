# Welcome to the Optimal Design Lab Wiki!

This wiki serves as a repository of information for, and by, the members of the Optimal Design Lab.

## Contributing to the Wiki

The Wiki is written almost entirely in Markdown using the MDwiki package; see [the MDwiki site](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki) for more information about how MDwiki works, as well as links to how to write content in Markdown.

There are two ways you can contribute to our wiki.

1. **You can modify/correct an exisiting page**.  Just clone the repo, and then look for the relevant page in the directory `en/pages`.  If you are having trouble finding the page based on its file name, you can try investigating the `en/navigation.md` file, which has the pull-down menu written in a modified list format.
2. **You can add new pages**.  First create a new markdown file (use the extension `.md`).  Then decide how users should navigate to your file: the new file should just be linked from an existing file, or; the new file should be available from the dropdown menu.  If you go with the latter, you will need to modifiy the `en/navigation.md` file appropriately.

If you want to know how to add an image, link to a file, or make a Latex equation, please refer to the MDwiki documentation.
