# Welcome to the Optimal Design Lab Wiki!

This wiki serves as a repository of information for, and by, the members of the Optimal Design Lab.

## Optimal Design Lab Web Resources

We make extensive use of the following web resources.  Once you join the lab Prof. Hicken will send you an invitation or set up an account for each one of these services ... if he doesn't, feel free to remind him.

* **Slack:** We use Slack for almost all communication. 
* **Google Calendar:** There is a lab calendar that we use to schedule recuring lab events (e.g. status meetings) and one-on-one meetings with Prof. Hicken.
* **Github:** We use [git](pages/git.md) for version control of software and academic papers/reports.  These git repositories are hosted on [github](https://github.com/OptimalDesignLab) to simplify collaboration
* **Wiki:** We use this wiki to record information for future use (either ours or future members of the lab).

## Contributing to the Wiki

The Wiki is written almost entirely in [Markdown](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links) using the MDwiki package; see [the MDwiki site](http://dynalon.github.io/mdwiki) for more information about how MDwiki works, as well as links to how to write content in Markdown.

There are two ways you can contribute to our wiki.

1. **You can modify/correct an exisiting page**.  Just clone the repo, and then look for the relevant page in the directory `en/pages`.  If you are having trouble finding the page based on its file name, you can try investigating the `en/navigation.md` file, which has the pull-down menu written in a modified list format.
2. **You can add new pages**.  First create a new markdown file (use the extension `.md`).  Then decide how users should navigate to your file: the new file should just be linked from an existing file, or; the new file should be available from the dropdown menu.  If you go with the latter, you will need to modifiy the `en/navigation.md` file appropriately.

If you want to know how to add an image, link to a file, or make a Latex equation, please refer to the MDwiki documentation.
