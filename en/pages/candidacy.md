# The Candidacy Process

I (Prof. Hicken) realized that the expectations and process surrounding the candidacy may not be entirely clear.  So, I wanted to add some comments to clarify things from my perspective.  I encourage any senior graduate students who have gone through the process to provide their own perspective (just make sure you distinguish your comments from mine with a subsection or quote or something).

## What is the candidacy?

Basically, the candidacy is an opportunity to summarize what you have done and what you will do to complete your thesis.  And, importantly, you provide this information to a group of people other than just me.  This group of people --- the committee --- will decide if the content of the research is adequate for a doctoral degree.  Thus, the candidacy provides a last chance to modify the research direction, so that the thesis defense has no surprises in it.  Imagine going straight to the defense without such input?  It would increase the chances of failing the defense, which nobody wants.

## When does the candidacy happen?

First, according to the OGE, the candidacy **must take place a year before the thesis defense**.  Please keep this constraint in mind.  Furthermore, the MANE Department suggests the candidacy take place within 2 years of passing the DQE; this is consistent with a 4 year degree (if starting from bachelors degree).

In my opinion, when you take the candidacy from the beginning of your degree is harder to judge --- it is dependent on the individual and the project.  But the bottom line is that I do not want to put someone in the position where the committee is challenging the work done as being adequate.  Here are some guidelines that usually ensure a smooth candidacy.

  * One or more journal papers have been submitted/accepted.
  * Three or more conference papers have been accepted and presented.
  * You understand the topic better than I do.  The point of doing a thesis is that you become _an expert_.  If I understand the subject better than you despite having spent much less time "in the trenches," this will not reflect well during the candidacy.


## Steps in preparing for the candidacy

Before the candidacy, we will have already identified a committee.  Then, roughly speaking, the following steps should take place **in order.**

1. You will prepare a draft of the candidacy report.  More on this below.
2. I will iterate with you on the draft.  **I need time to do this!!!**  Please budget 2 weeks at least for me. Strictly speaking, you could send the document to the committee without my input; however, if you do this (please don't!) I will be reluctant to defend anything you said in the document that I disagree with.
3. Once we are happy with the draft, you can send it to the committee.
4. At the same time you send the report to the committee, you can ask them which weeks would work best for the candidacy presentation.  I recommend providing at least 3 choices, and they should be at least 2 weeks away from when you sent the report.
5. Once a week has been identified, immediately send a poll (e.g. Doodle) to find a 2 hour slot.  Try to stay between 9am and 5pm, and avoid lunch please; we need to eat too.
6. Again, as soon as a time has been identified, immediately send an email letting the committee know the date and time that works.  If you have room reserved already, let them know where it will be held; if you do not have a room, let them know you will send a follow up email with the location.
7. If you do not have a room, reserve it now!  Then send an email to the committee with the room location.
7. Start working on your candidacy presentation; once the presentation slides are ready, please send them to me for comment.
8. About a week before the candidacy, we will practice the candidacy presentation.
9. One or two days before the candidacy, send the committee an email reminding them of the time, date, and location of the candidacy.  Provide the slides as a pdf file at this time as well.
10. Give the candidacy.

Steps 5-6 may need to happen twice if the weeks/times you propose do not work out.


## The candidacy report

The candidacy report should be a concise (MANE Grad student handbooks says 15 pages max, although I have seen plenty of students exceed this) with the following covered:

* Your proposed research/thesis objective, what work has been done in the field, what challenges exist, what your contribution will be.
* What you have already done. This may require several chapters in the final thesis.
* What you will do before graduation.
