# Thoughts on Presentations

Scientific presentations should act like an advertisement for the related paper.  Therefore, the objective is to get the attention of your target "market" (other researchers working in your field or related fields), and convince them that this work is worth a closer look.  Presentations that do this job well are often significantly different that "traditional" scientific presentations.  By traditional, I mean the stereotypical presentation filled with equations, packed with too much text, and obscured by difficult to understand plots.

Jean-luc Doumont has some good pointers about creating slides and presentations, most of which I agree with.  Before you create any presentation, whether for the lab or a conference, please review his notes, posted below.  You might also consider watching his YouTube video in the list of links below.
