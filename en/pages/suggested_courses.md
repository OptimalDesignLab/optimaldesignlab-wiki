# Advice on courses
Here is some advice on classes that have been helpful towards advancing our & the lab's research goals. 

## Essential

 * Whichever Optimization course Prof. Hicken is teaching (possibly MANE 6963)
 * MANE 6960 Adjoints for Scientists & Engineers
 * MANE 6960 Fluid Mechanics
 * CSCI 6360 Parallel Computing
 * MANE 6660 Fundamentals of Finite Elements
 * MATH 6840 Numerical Solutions of PDEs (if Prof. Banks is teaching)

## Suggested

The things in parentheses are possible research topics that if you're working on, the class would be helpful.

 * MANE 4800 Boundary Layers & Heat Transfer  (boundary layers)
 * MANE 6680 Finite Element Programming (PUMI/meshing)
 * MANE 6550 Compressible Flow (compressible effects, basic finite differencing CFD concepts)
 * MANE 6530 Turbulence (note: very infrequently offered, so take it when you can)
 * MATH 6890 Wave Equations (Euler equations)
 
## Helpful, but not required

 * MANE 6560 Incompressible Flow (more about shallow waves, surfactants, vortex dynamics)
 * MANE 6720 Computational Fluid Dynamics (mainly about PHASTA)

## See a labmate for elaboration

 * MATH 6800 Computational Linear Algebra
