# Writing Papers and Reports

## Produce the Theory and Results First

There is no point writing the paper if you have no theory or results to put in it.  If your paper will have theoretical results, write down the theorems with their proofs.  Produce _drafts_ of figures that best explain your results.

## Write an Outline

Begin by identifying what information you want to convey to the reader, then
1) Determine and list the main sections of the paper.
2) In each section, describe (in point/bullet form) what the contents of that section will be.
3) Place your draft figures in the appropriate sections.

## Writing the Introduction

Writing the introduction is probably the hardest part of creating a paper.  I recently came across a good set of questions, based on those introduced by George H. Heilmeier, that you should make sure you answer (either implicitly or explicitly) in your introduction.  Here they are:

1) What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
2) How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
3) What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
4) Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?

If you have not answered these questions in the introduction...**try again**.

## Writing the Abstract

I write the abstract last, since it is a summary of the paper.  The abstract should be as concise and clearly identify the most significant contributions.  It may be tempting to include details that you struggled to understand or that you find interesting, but _do not do this_.
