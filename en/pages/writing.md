# Writing Papers and Reports

## Produce the Theory and Results First

There is no point writing the paper if you have no theory or results to put in it.  If your paper will have theoretical results, write down the theorems with their proofs.  Produce _drafts_ of figures that best explain your results.

## Write an Outline

Begin by identifying what information you want to convey to the reader, then
1) Determine and list the main sections of the paper.
2) In each section, describe (in point/bullet form) what the contents of that section will be.
3) Place your draft figures in the appropriate sections.

After you have produced the outline and preliminary results/theory, you should discuss the structure and results with your co-authors (especially me, Prof. Hicken).

## Writing the Introduction

Writing the introduction is probably the hardest part of creating a paper.  I recently came across a good set of questions, based on those introduced by George H. Heilmeier, that you should make sure you answer (either implicitly or explicitly) in your introduction.  Here they are:

1) What are you trying to do? Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
2) How is it done today, and what are the limits of current practice?
3) What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
4) Who cares? If you succeed, what difference will it make?

If you have not answered these questions in the introduction...**try again**.

## Writing the Abstract

I write the abstract last, since it is a summary of the paper.  The abstract should be as concise and clearly identify the most significant contributions.  It may be tempting to include details that you struggled to understand or that you find interesting, but _do not do this_.

## Other Resources

We have access to Joshua Schimel's book _"Writing Science: how to write papers that get cited and proposals that get funded"_ as an e-book through the RPI library.  I highly recomend this book.  We read several chapters as part of our literature review in 2017/2018, and we will likely do so again.  While the author comes from a different field, his general remarks are quite universal.

## Revising Scholarly Manuscripts—Briskly and Well

The following is taken from Gray, T. (2020). _Writing your dissertation quickly and well_. In K. Townsend, M. N. K. Saunders, R. Loudoun, & E. A. Morrison (Eds.) How to keep your doctorate on track: Insights from students’ and supervisors’ experiences.

While the title is about dissertations, the excerpt here is focused on papers.

### Identify—or Write—a Key Sentence for Each Manuscript and Paragraph

In this step, you will identify—or write—a topic or key sentence for each manuscript and paragraph. A topic sentence may announce only the topic, but a key sentence also announces the point. Key sentences are stronger than topic sentences because they unlock the meaning of the manuscript or paragraph by giving the reader a better sense of direction.

Readers expect nonfiction to have one point per manuscript and per paragraph, announced in a key sentence (Baker, 2006, pp. 36–38; Williams & Bizup, 2017, pp. 109–120). Although readers expect keys, writers do not always provide them. Two prominent journal editors (Belcher, 2019, p. 66; Olson, 1997, pp. 59–61) reported that the major reason journal manuscripts are rejected is that they do not have a single topic or key sentence that announces the purpose or point of the manuscript clearly and early. Another leading writing expert (Bean, 2011, p. 325) says that when he is asked to help academics revise their writing, he comments most frequently on [the lack of] topic or key sentences in paragraphs. Clearly, your writing will profit when you attend to topic or key sentences. It may sound like it would be slow to do, but it cleans up prose so quickly that it is actually faster.

Place your keys early, whether in the manuscript or the paragraph; after all, we are not writing mysteries (Belcher, 2019, p. 265; Huff, 1999, p. 72). Academic readers want to skim and skip as they read. Therefore, they “want to know from the start that the butler did it” (Ratnoff, 1981, p. 96; Belcher, 2019, p. 265). Academics read journal articles, grant proposals, and even paragraphs looking for the point. Therefore, they are more likely to read more if they understand the point. “Articles that withhold their purpose, import, or conclusions until their end [are muddled]. They must actively avoid being clear so that the mystery is sustained” (Belcher, 2019, p. 265). . . .

This is also true when you write a paragraph—announce your key at or near the beginning of the paragraph and then organize the paragraph around the point. Check each paragraph to see if it has a key sentence that announces the topic—and the point—of the paragraph before providing adequate support or evidence for it. In some paragraphs, this may be as simple as identifying the key sentence that you have already written; in others, you may have to write a key sentence and then rewrite the paragraph to support it.

To organize within each paragraph, remember that, in non-fiction, readers expect paragraphs to provide three elements in this order: transition, key or topic sentence, and support or evidence. Follow this order unless you occasionally have a reason for breaking it. Start your paragraphs with a transition, which ties the material from one paragraph to the next, providing coherence. A transition may be as short as a word or a phrase harkening back to the previous paragraph or as long as a sentence or two. After the transition, provide a key or topic sentence. Finally, provide evidence to support that key sentence. By ordering your paragraphs in this way, you will have provided within-paragraph organization.

Topic sentences are the same as key sentences, with one important difference, as mentioned above. A topic sentence may announce only a topic, but a key sentence announces the topic and asserts the point. So, a topic sentence might say, “Next, we discuss the nutritional value of apples and oranges.” In contrast, a key sentence would provide the key by telling its point: “Next, we argue that the nutritional value of an apple is superior to that of an orange.” Again, key sentences are stronger than topic sentences because they unlock the meaning of the paragraph and give the reader a better sense of direction.

Key sentences share characteristics with topic sentences. The ideal key sentence occurs early in the paragraph. It announces the point simply and with little detail. A key does not try to prove the point because the rest of the paragraph does that. It is broad enough to cover everything in the paragraph—but no broader. A key sentence uses key words as subjects, rather than using pronouns such as “she,” “they,” or “it.”

Next, try finding a key sentence in a few paragraphs in this posting. Read the posting paragraph by paragraph backwards, starting with the last paragraph in the posting. By reading backwards you will keep the focus on each paragraph, rather than getting distracted by reading the entire manuscript. Begin at the end of this posting, and hunt for key sentences until you develop the skill of identifying them. 

Now, try finding keys in the most polished part of a manuscript you have written but not yet published. In a well-written paragraph, the key sentence is easy to find. If you can’t find your keys easily, your reader won’t be able to find them at all. In this case, rewrite any given paragraph to include a key and then reorganize the paragraph around it. It is normal to have difficulty finding a key in each paragraph of your own work. In my workshops, participants can’t easily find keys in the writing samples I give them or in their own writing. So, practice on relatively easy prose (this post) and then work up to your most polished prose and finally to your own early drafts. Across time, you will learn how to write with keys as the most self-conscious writers do. You want to emulate these fine writers, not the average writer.

### Make a List of Key Sentences as an After-the-fact Outline

In the last step, you worked on organization within paragraphs; next, focus on organization betweenparagraphs. To examine between-paragraph organization, make a list of the key sentences you identified in the last step. Making this after-the-fact outline is sometimes called a “reverse” outline because it is written after the paper, not before. Now, make sure that the minor points communicate your main purpose to your audience. Next, ensure that the minor points in each of your paragraphs are organized logically and coherently.

Reverse outlines help your readers and you. They help your readers because they are actually in the manuscript so they show the structure of the paper to your reader, helping the reader skim and skip, which is how academics read. The reverse outline helps you as a writer because you can see the structure of the manuscript without all the distracting detail. This is especially true if you make a list of key sentences instead of merely highlighting the keys in the paragraphs. Writing and reading the outline gives form and structure to your writing and thinking. This method of working with key sentences is very effective, but it can appear to be slow because it may cause you to reorganize. In the end though, it will be faster and you will have a better product because you will achieve greater clarity and organization in your thinking and writing.

To make a list of key sentences and headings, take these actions. Create a new, blank document and place the title and the purpose (key sentence) of the manuscript at the top of the page. Then, copy and paste into the document the key sentences you identified in the last step. Next, read the list sentence by sentence backwards. As you read, make sure each sentence helps communicate the purpose to the audience. Next, read the list of key sentences forwards, making sure each sentence is organized logically and coherently.

As you read your key sentences, consider the value and placement of each key and its corresponding paragraph. When a key sentence doesn’t add value by helping communicate the main purpose to the audience, drop that sentence and its corresponding paragraph. Similarly, when two key sentences are placed illogically in reverse order, reverse both the key sentences and the paragraphs they come from. Finally, re-read the manuscript forwards, making sure the changes in the whole manuscript are to your liking.
